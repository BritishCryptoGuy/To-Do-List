# To Do list (simple app)

## Short description of To Do app

This simple app is used for storing "To Do list" information. This information is then saved to the local storage and loading on each return visit. This was created originally for coding practice but decided to upload for my own personal use. App should work on multiple devices due to media queries having been implemented

### User Story

```
AS A person with things to do
I WANT an app that i can use to store my to do list
SO THAT i can use it to store data and tick off items upon completion
```

### Acceptance Criteria

My app should allow users to input their to do's and have them display on the UI. On return visits the stored to do's should load. Once the user has completed a task they can click complete and have the task be deleted. The app should work on multiple device types
